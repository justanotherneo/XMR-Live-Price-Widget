CRZYCYBR

Program Instructions at the bottom if you want to skip right to them, but I would appreciate a moment of your time to read the intro below.

-I created this program to try my best with my current minimal programming skillset to serve the Monero community to the best of my ability. This program is a simple desktop widget that shows
XMR Monero's live price. It queries an API every second to fetch the current price of Monero.

If you would like to support my work following my Youtube channel is the best way to do that. CRZYCYBR is the name of my channel. As of 1/23/25 I am in the middle of building a dual AMD
EPYC 7551 XMR Miner build that I have named Hulk. It has a custom fabricated open chassis, 64 Cores and 128 Threads between the two CPUS, custom hardline water cooling, and two different 
external metrics displays. I'm having a lot of fun with the build and fabrication on the chassis has just been completed. 

I look forward to supporting the Monero network and truly believe it will be a large part of the resistanse of a totalitarian state. Now more than ever, it is of the utmost importance that
we the people take back control of the money. As one of the Rothschilds once said "I care not who sits on the throne, if I control the nations banking, I am the nations true ruler" Its time
for us all to be our own rulers. Those with eyes, let them see.
